      install_method:
        description: |
          Specifies how (and if) the cloudify agent should be installed.
          Valid values are:
          * none - No agent will be installed on the host.
          * remote - An agent will be installed using SSH on linux hosts and WinRM on windows hosts.
          * init_script - An agent will be installed via a script that will run on the host when it gets created.
                          This method is only supported for specific IaaS plugins.
          * plugin - An agent will be installed via a plugin which will run a script on the host.
                     This method is only supported for specific IaaS plugins.
          * provided - An agent is assumed to already be installed on the host image.
                       That agent will be configured and started via a script that will run on the host when it gets created.
                       This method is only supported for specific IaaS plugins.

      service_name:
        description: |
          Used to set the the cloudify agent service name.
          If not set, the default value for the service name is:
          - Linux: 'celery-<id>'
          - Windows: '<id>'
          where 'id' is the instance id of the compute node in which the agent is running.
          Note: the value in this field, takes precedence over the deprecated
          'cloudify.nodes.Compute.cloudify_agent.name'.

      network:
        description: >
          The name of the manager network to which the agent should be
          connected. By default, the value will be `default` (which is the
          manager's private IP, by default)
        type: string

        description: >
          For host agents that are installed via SSH, this is the path to the private
          key that will be used to connect to the host.
          In most cases, this value will be derived automatically during bootstrap.
        type: string
        required: false
      password:
        description: >
          For host agents that are installed via SSH (on linux) and WinRM (on windows)
          this property can be used to connect to the host.
          For linux hosts, this property is optional in case the key property is properly configured
          (either explicitly or implicitly during bootstrap).
          For windows hosts that are installed via WinRM, this property is also optional
          and depends on whether the password runtime property has been set by the relevant IaaS plugin,
          prior to the agent installation.
        type: string

      port:
        description: >
          For host agents that are installed via SSH (on linux) and WinRM (on windows),
          this is the port used to connect to the host.

          Note: For windows based agents, this property is ignored and min_workers is set to the value of max_workers.
        type: integer
        required: false
      max_workers:
        description: >
          Maximum number of agent workers. By default, the value will be 5.
